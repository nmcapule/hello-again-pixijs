# Hello (again) Pixi JS

This mostly started as my review of the amazing Pixi.js library which I used
around 10 years ago in a severely underpowered Raspberry-like device. After a
while, I started to explore implementing entity-component-systems, highly
inspired by the amazing [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) game engine.

I had lots of learnings regarding TypeScript's typing system and the inherent
simplicity and advantages of implementing your own games via ECS architecture
(if you know where to look).
